# Tools for Wildlife Insights (`wi_tools`)

Wildlife Insights tools developed to streamline use of the platform as part of the Sentinel Sites for Nature Network. Many of these tools may be useful to WI users outside the network as well.

Each tool in this repository is currently in use -- please report bugs or submit feature requests via GitHub; if you want to contribute, create your own branch and request to merge when your contribution is ready. Please do not work on the live main branch!

### [**Current tools:**]{.underline}

[WI Image Distributor]{.underline}: This tool takes an image table from a Wildlife Insights project and divides unverified images into assignments for taggers.
