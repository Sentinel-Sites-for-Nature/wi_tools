## Function to create image assignments for Wildlife Insights projects

                   studentTable=NULL, ## This expects a gradebook CSV export from Canvas, though it will also accept a character vector of names.
                   progressCounts=FALSE, ## If TRUE, this returns a summary of progress so far by each student who has registered and identified at least one photo in the WI image table you've included.
                   progressAccounting=FALSE, ## If students are already working but you want to assign additional photos, setting this to TRUE will re-allocate fewer photos to students who have completed more (i.e. be fair and equal for a lab exercise).  Note that this will ignore the studentList names and reallocate based on every user who has tagged an image in the Wildlife Insights project. You can pre-filter out any users you don't want to include here.
                   nStudents=NA, ## If you don't provide table with student names, you can specify the number of students / buckets to divide images across or how many times to assign imagesPerStudent.
                   imagesPerStudent=NA, ## If set, this will limit the number of images assigned per student to your provided number, rather than dividing all unverified images between students.
                   byDeployment=FALSE, ## Should assignments be created per-deployment rather than purely date/time within a project?  This can be helpful as a student will not swap as often (or at all) between cameras/backgrounds, and won't need to worry about timestamps, but they must be trained to filter by deployment in addition to dates.
                   #bridgeDeployments=TRUE, ## Sould assignments bridge deployments?  I.e. can a student be assigned images in multiple deployments and have 2 lines in the assignment table?
                   blankVal=1.0 ## This can be set between 1.0, which treats blanks as any other photo, and 0, which means that blanks, while still in each assignment, don't count towards the total photos assigned. Any other number between 0 and 1 (i.e a percentage) will count each blank as a "fraction" of a photo when counting towards the total assigned.
